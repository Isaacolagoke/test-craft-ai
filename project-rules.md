# Project Rules

## Layout Rules

### Dashboard Layout Pattern

- All dashboard and quiz creation pages must use the DashboardLayout component
- Layout specifications:
  - Full-width slate-50 (bg-slate-50) background
  - always ask for design rules. don't ever make any ui or design changes on your own, unless i give you the permission and look and feel.
  - Centered white container with max-width of 700px that spans full viewport height
  - Fixed header contained within the 700px width
  - Consistent padding: px-4 sm:px-6 md:px-container-padding
  - Header must have:
    - White background
    - Bottom border (border-b border-slate-200)
    - Logo and profile menu
    - Fixed position within the 700px container
  - Content must start with pt-16 to account for fixed header

This layout ensures visual hierarchy with the slate background and maintains consistent spacing and containment across all dashboard pages.
